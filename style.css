         <h2> <center> Spawn is the starting point for new players and the place where players without beds respawn, making it the most populated place on 2b2t. It is arguably the most infamous part of the server. So in the first couple of days, most of the damage done to Spawn was from creepers. There were a lot of mobs around at that point in time, and lots of nakeds, cause advertising on a 4chan board, you just get loads and loads of people visiting, especially at that time, which was, the center of the Minecraft community along with a couple of small forums, but basically, you know, the game was very popular on that board and, as for the server, you just get 50—60 people joining at a time. Spawn became pretty much wrecked straight away, lavacasts, creeper holes were everywhere. pYr01v1aniac stated that players spawned in a radius of 50 or 100 blocks from 0,0, making 0,0 "very busy", with players chasing and punching each other. Hausemaster eventually made a 16x16 obsidian platform at 0,0 to avoid creepers exploding large holes killing new players.

Several walls have been made around Spawn, the most significant being the Great Obsidian Wall built during the Sixth Incursion in April and May 2018, and the Linked Horizon Wall which was built in 2021.

Withers have been used to grief spawn on a regular basis since 2013. Withers usually generate large holes and end up destroying the area just above bedrock. This is what has resulted in the wither cave below spawn. </center> </h2>

       <h2> <center> The Rusher War, also known as the Rusher Invasion, was a major conflict on 2b2t that took place during the summer of 2016 and ending in the mid-fall of 2016. The war is highly controversial as many have varying opinions on the subject. Some claim that the war saved the server as it gave the server a long-needed "revival" (some say a little too much of a revival), as many players quit or migrated to Constantiam after the early 2016 backdoor crisis. Others believed that it was nothing but staged YouTube drama and used solely to benefit the many YouTubers involved, such as TheCampingRusher and FitMC. The war was mainly between Team Rusher and Team Veteran, however they were also some smaller groups involved in the war such as The Resistance, and the Peacekeepers. The war took place from June 13th to October 9th, 2016. The conflict also promoted new forms of PVP like bed/crystal bombings. On June 4, 2016, Rusher declared war on the oldfags, which he called "OGs", and established Team Rusher. June 13, 2016, can be considered the first day of The War, as, on this day, Fit was chosen to be the leader of Team Veteran. Fit posted a massacre of 40 Rushers and many other anti-Rusher videos beforehand on his YouTube channel. On July 17, a war meeting was conducted by the newly founded Team Veteran which assembled many old players. The war continued on the original map of 2b2t and the queue system was given an upgrade by Rusher himself. </center> </h2>
